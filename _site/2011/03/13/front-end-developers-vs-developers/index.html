    <h2>Front-End Is Way Harder Than Back-End</h2>
<p>
  Developing web sites with HTML, CSS and templating languages like Liquid 
  and writing programs &mdash; in Ruby, Python, PHP etc. &mdash; is not the same thing, at all.
</p>

<p>
  Programming languages are older and more advanced than markup and styling languages. They focus on data,
  not humans as in case of web design and development.
</p>
<p>
  Manipulating code bits living in an abstract but uniform environment &mdash; like the computer &mdash; is easier than 
  manipulating pixels living in the perception of humans, millions of them and all different.
</p>

<p>
  Code and data runs in standard virtual machines when front-end results run on displays which vary from mobile handsets to large 
  projector screens, and, are rendered by many different browsers.
</p>

<p>
  Coding web sites is like shooting on a moving target; 
  back-end programming, well, on the other hand is stable, testable, more straightforward.
</p>
  

<h2>Tools And Best Practices For Front-End Developers</h2>
<p>
  Yes, you can have them too.
</p>  

<p>
  You'll never have that advanced ecosystem a full-featured programming language is equipped with: automated tests,
  intelligent debugger & performance analyser, code coverage tool, documentation generator, frameworks built
  on frameworks, and all.
</p>

<p>
  But you can re-use the back-end <em>principles</em> of creating good code in front-end development too, and, you can adapt 
  as well some of the <em>tools</em> back-end developers use. 
</p>
<p>
  A good starting point for analysis could be the 
  <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/" title="The Ruby Programming Language">Ruby programming language</a> and the 
  <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" title="The Ruby on Rails Web Development Ecosystem">Ruby on Rails web development platform</a>, 
  probably the best tools of the moment for creating web applications:
</p>
  
<h3>1. Human Friendly Code</h3>
<p>
  Ruby was created / optimised for developers, not the machine.
</p>  
<p>
  Programming with Ruby is very straightforward today, the language constructs are so close
  to plain English even a child can understood and use them. 
</p>
<p>
  Ruby code needs no documentation &mdash; it is so elegant it documents itself.
</p>

<p>
&mdash;
</p>

<p>
  As a first lesson try to create human friendly, readable, understandable design code which documents itself. 
</p>
<p>
  Make your design your friend. Changing, editing, reviewing, enhancing, extending a Ruby code is always a joy.
  In contrast, your HTML or CSS code will suck after a while even for you, the creator.
</p>
<p class="summary">
  The biggest challenge in web front-end development is to integrate, by innovative and meticulous naming techniques 
  the HTML, CSS and Javascript elements into a seamlessly co-working entity. 
</p>
<p>
  Mark your code in a straightforward, easily rememberable way which works in any context assuring the <em>flow</em>. 
  So you don't have to look up different source files to find out how to style, or add interaction to an element.  
</p>

  
<h3>2. Don't Repeat Yourself</h3>
<p>
  Scalability is everything, you know.
</p>
<p>
  This principle turned out to be a very strong building block of the success of the Rails framework.
</p>
<p>
  Rails was created by substracting the essence from a well known, top notch web application (Basecamp) created with Ruby. 
  All best practices were turned into reusable modules forming the framework itself.
</p>
<p>
  Basecamp, thus Rails was continuously refactored and optimised until all fat was trimmed.
  The outcome was the simplest and most robust tool which can be reused, again, to create more successful applications
  in a faster and easier way.
</p>
<p>
  Smart people are maximising the outcome of every work they done. Beside the final product there is always something more:
   an enhanced tool&mdash; and mindset helping them to do better on the next project.
</p> 
<p>
  They don't repeat themselves. Instead the tool, the framework, the ecosystem they have <em>extracted</em> repeats and embeds 
  itself automagicaly in every following project they create.
</p>
<p class="summary">
  Web front-end development is lacking tools and frameworks back-end developers are equipped with. 
  Industry best practices are not extracted into a common knowledge base and then enhanced by a community. 
  Designing for web is not scalable.
</p>



<h3>3. Test Driven Front-End Development</h3>
<p>
  I know it sounds impossible. No test tool can <em>see</em> as human eyes do.
</p>
<p>
  But if back-end developers can do it maybe the front-enders will be able to do so.
</p>
<p>
  In an ideal scenario &mdash; you have human friendly design code and a powerful design framework built on your best
  knowledge &mdash; a strong HTML/CSS/Javascript base is at your disposal whenever you start a new project.
</p>
<p>
  This framework in order to be perfect must be tested on various browsers, operating systems, display sizes, color depths 
  and so on.
  No testing tool will warn you on bugs like this.
</p>
<p>
  In Webkit if you add newline in your source code for a link the design will broke.

  <script src="https://gist.github.com/867212.js?file=button-webkit.html"></script>
  
  This will cause the following broken button on Webkit browsers (on Firefox all is fine):
  <br/><br/>
  <img src="/images/webkit-bug.png" alt="A Bug In Webkit Browsers" />
</p>

<p class="summary">
  Enter <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome" title="Amazon Mechanical Turk">Amazon's Mechanical Turk</a>. 
  If web designers would unite into a community distilling the best practices into a framework
  using human test power all elements of that framework would be tested, bullet proof, for all browsers and operating systems 
  for nothing.
</p>



<h2>And the tl;dr</h2>
<p>
  Front end developers (HTML/CSS programmers) should learn from their back end developer brothers 
  (coding in Ruby, Python etc.) to make their everyday work more enjoyable, more bullet-proof and widely sustained.  
</p>
<p>
  The current front-end developer elite shares some thoughts on best practices, maintains a few boilerplate 
  templates but there are no frameworks and ecosystems as in back-end development 
  empowering both its creators and users.
</p>
<p class='summary'>
  Both principles and tools can be borrowed / adapted from back-end developers &mdash; 
  what we only need is a charismatic leader to lead the process and become a hero.
