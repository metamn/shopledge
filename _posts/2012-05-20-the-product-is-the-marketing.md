> Before if you were making a product, the right business strategy was to 
> put 70% of your attention, energy, and dollars into shouting about a product,

Since then ...

> The balance of *power is shifting toward consumers* and away from companies 
> ... the individual is empowered ...

Finally ...

> If you are a company put the vast majority of your energy, 
> attention and dollars into building a great product or service and 
> *put a smaller amount into shouting about it, marketing it.* 
> If I build a great product or service, my customers will tell each other.

## Your Customers Are The Marketers

When you build something with high informational and emotional value you manufacture
*buzz and desire*.

People will start talking about, will build their own *status* around your products.
You'll use the power of the crowd to run your business. 
**Crowd-sourcing** is the magic happening in this decade.

We came to an era when people are taking control over their lives &mdash; over
everything they interact with &mdash; like companies and products.
And they do it voluntarily, for free, adding love and requesting only a 
little attention as reward.

 

## Crowd-source Everything

Few years ago I've written an article about 
[Community Driven Web Shopping](http://clair.ro/blog/2009/08/18/community-driven-web-shopping/ "Comunity Driven Web Shopping")
stating:

> Following years will be about a shift in e-commerce. 
> Now shop owners are presenting products to customers 
> later customers will ask for products and services without entering a shop.

This is about crowd-sourcing the inventory items your shop will sale.
You don't have to look after wholesale companies for products 
but listen to people and they will tell you what they want to buy.

There is a buzzword for that, called content marketing.

In the latest [Econsultancy report](http://econsultancy.com/uk/reports/digital-trends-and-content-marketing) 
about digital trends and their impact on marketing we have a following summary from
[Seth Godin, the marketing god](http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/):

> Content marketing is the only marketing left.

### But what content marketing is?

1. **Discovering needs** using social networks and data mining tools.
2. **Aggregating and curating** content related to these topics. 
3. **Creating original content** and making it vendible.
4. **Distributing content** on channels where consumers are able to **engage** with.

### In a content driven e-commerce company

1. Your product is defined by the crowd. 
2. You add some magic.
3. And let them play with. 

Market research, marketing and sales *all* crowd-sourced. 
The only left is *content production*.
