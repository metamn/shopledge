  - title: The Product is the Marketing
    url: article1.png
excerpt: Instead of spending dollars on marketing *make use of* your audience.
---

> Before if you were making a product, the right business strategy was to 
> put 70% of your attention, energy, and dollars into shouting about a product, 
> and 30% into making a great product (...)

Since then ...

> The balance of *power is shifting toward consumers* and away from companies 
> ... the individual is empowered ...

Finally ...

> If you are a company put the vast majority of your energy, 
> attention and dollars into building a great product or service and 
> *put a smaller amount into shouting about it, marketing it.* 
> If I build a great product or service, my customers will tell each other.

## Your Customers Are The Marketers

When you build something with *high informational and emotional value* you manufacture
*buzz and desire*.

People will start talking about, will build their own *status* around your products.
You'll use the power of the crowd to run your business. 
**Crowd-sourcing** is the magic happening in this decade.

We came to an era when people are taking control over their lives -- over
everything they interact with -- so companies and products.
And they do it voluntarily, for free, adding love and requesting only a 
little attention as reward.

 

## Crowd-source Everything

Few years ago I've written an article about 
[Comunity Driven Web Shopping](http://clair.ro/blog/2009/08/18/community-driven-web-shopping/ "Comunity Driven Web Shopping")
stating:

> Following years will be about a shift in e-commerce. 
> Now shop owners are presenting products to customers 
> later customers will ask for products and services without entering a shop.

In the latest [Econsultancy report](http://econsultancy.com/) about 
digital trends and their impact on marketing we have a following summary from
[Seth Godin, the marketing god](http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/):

> Content marketing is the only marketing left.

### But what content marketing is?

1. **Discovering needs** using social networks and data mining tools.
2. **Aggregating and curating** content related to these topics. 
3. **Creating original content** and making it vendible.
4. **Distributing content** on channels where consumers are able to **engage** with.
