The most important task of every e-commerce site is to turn
as much visitors as possible into customers.
Customers who either *buy now* or make a commitment for buying later.

This is possible only if you deal differently with each visitor,
by offering them a personalized experience. 

## The Continuous Erosion Of The Conversion Rate

In our experience conversion rate &mdash; turning visitors into customers
&mdash; halves on every step visitors make until the final purchase.

<div id="infogr" class="article4 block">
  <ul>
    <li><h4>Browse Products</h4></li>
    <li id="id1">
      <img id="arrow1" src="{{ site.images }}/arrow1-black.png" />
      <div id="text">Original Conversion Rate</div>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Add to cart</h4></li>
    <li id="id2">
      <img id="arrow1" src="{{ site.images }}/arrow1-black.png" />
      <div id="text"><strong>50%</strong> of the Add To Cart Rate</div>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Go To Checkout</h4></li>
    <li id="id3">
      <img id="arrow1" src="{{ site.images }}/arrow1-black.png" />
      <div id="text"><strong>50%</strong> of the Checkout Rate</div>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Make Purchase</h4></li>
  </ul>
</div>

So far, from the *Add to cart* to *Make Purchase* we have lost **75%** of
our would be customers.

In order to find out why, we have to carefully analyze <em>real-time</em>
every click of every visitor and respond differently based on their 
individual behaviour.  

## Real Time Visitor Analytics And Segmentation

Currently there are a few external tools available to analyze 
customer behaviour in real-time. Big players like 
Google Analytics, Mixpanel & co are offering *only* post-mortem analytics 
on what happened on your site.

Why? Because your e-commerce engine must be capable to track every interaction
every visitor does on your site, and respond accordingly,
based on their clicks and current goals &mdash; the mindset
they have right now visiting your site.

With behavioral tracking you can identify:

* New or returning visitors
* Visitors who are just looking around
* Visitors who are willing to buy but not sure yet
* Visitors who are really here to buy

Once identified they can be treated differently:

* Returning visitors can be rewarded
* For visitors just hanging around additional services can be offered:
  * Subscribe to newsletter for promo codes and coupons 
  * Use a personalized product finder
  * Tell us when you are willing to buy and how much you are planning to spend
  * and more ...
* Unsure visitors can be aided by additional incentives:
  * Compare prices and make sure this is the best deal
  * Add to wishlist to get sale prices
  * and more ...
  
## Responsive E-commerce

Yes, like 
[modern website design](http://johnpolacek.github.com/scrolldeck.js/decks/responsive/)
adapting to different devices &mdash; smartphone, tablet, desktop monitor 
&mdash; in the same way your e-commerce site must adapt to 
different visitor segments.

Or put it more broadly:
