excerpt: All of them are to increase the Conversion Rate
---

Like your campaign and product performance &mdash; 
your online store must be measurable too.

The site makes the sales &mdash; you must fine tune every aspect to keep it
perform better.

## Single Point Of Success, Single Point Of Failure

Your website is your front-end and has the largest impact on your *entire* business. 

Usually **1-2%** of your visitors reaching your site are converted into customers. 
Now imagine a **5-6%** conversion rate. 
That would immediately triple your sales.

The Conversion Rate is that single point where all your efforts can be turned either
into success or into failure.

With:

* A high conversion rate your energies spent on marketing and product
creation are multiplied. 

* A low conversion rate no matter how good your products are and how much 
traffic you drive to your site &mdash; your sales will be modest.

Put simply, **Conversion Rate** is the

of your visitors to become customers,
to buy your products.
