Like your [campaign performance]({{ site.url }}/run-profitable-campaigns/ "Run Profitable Campaigns") 
your online store must be measurable too.

After all he site makes the sales &mdash; you must fine tune every aspect 
of your webshop to perform better.

## Single Point Of Success, Single Point Of Failure

Your website is your front-end and has the largest impact on your *entire* business. 

Usually **1-2%** of your visitors reaching your site are converted into customers. 
Now imagine a **5-6%** conversion rate. 
That would immediately triple your sales.

The Conversion Rate is that single point where all your efforts can be turned either
into success or into failure.

With:

* A high conversion rate your energies spent on marketing and product
creation are multiplied. 

* Low conversion rate no matter how good your products are and how much 
traffic you drive to your site &mdash; your sales will be modest.

Put simply, **Conversion Rate** is the

> willingness 

of your visitors to become customers.


## Understanding Willingness

To understand how your visitors act remember how you do shop online.
What makes you happy and what not.

### 1

Probably the first thing you demand from a website is **speed**.
If a page loads slow, in more seconds than you expect 
you'll abandon immediately.


### 2

Once you've got the site loaded into your browser you'll try to realise
if this is **the experience you are looking for**, or not.

Are there interesting products? Are they presented well?
Does the site looks good? Do you feel confident what you see?

If all's well then you'll start looking to buy, otherwise you'll bounce away.


### 3

Ok there's a product you might be interested.
You'll add to cart only if you are sure this will be a good deal.

And what makes a **good deal?**

1. The product is exactly what you are looking for.
2. It is presented well, made it desirable, all details are clear and understandable.
3. The price is okay.

In this case you'll probably add the product to the cart.


### 4

Once the product is in the cart the most critical part of your 
shopping experience happens.
You'll start thinking about spending money.

And when you'll spend money for sure?

1. When you are re-assured the product in your cart is exactly what you want.

2. The price is really ok, and won't get better, can't be made better.

3. The payment, shipping, delivery is fine.

4. There won't be any problems with the purchased product. If yes there is
a good support to handle it.

When you'll **abandon** shopping?

1. You've put in the basket the product(s) just to bookmark it, to
remember later.

2. You don't really need it right now.

3. You are not sure about the price, if you can buy it or not elsewhere at a
better deal.

4. Something is wrong with the service, something unexpected happened: 
there are hidden costs, the delivery is not what you would expect, 
not sure if this is a good purchase for long term, etc.

## Putting It All Together

There are several factors influencing your visitors willingness to become
customers.

As better you manage these factors as much your Conversion Rate &mdash; 
the single most important e-commerce metric &mdash; grows.

It is important to model how your visitors think & interact with your site
and measure every step they make.
