## Single Point Of Success, Single Point Of Failure

Your website, the front-end store has the largest impact on your *entire* business. 

Usually **1-2%** of your visitors who reach your site are converted into customers. 
Now imagine a **5-6%** conversion rate. 
That would immediately triple your sales.

> The Conversion Rate makes the difference!

It is that single point where all your efforts can be turned either
into success or into failure.

With:

* A high conversion rate your energies spent on marketing and product
creation are multiplied. 

* A low conversion rate no matter how good your products are and how much 
traffic you drive to your site &mdash; your sales will be modest.
