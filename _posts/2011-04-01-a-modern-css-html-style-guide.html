<h2>The Pain</h2>
<p>
  As we've seen in a <a href="http://dev.shopledge.com/2011/03/13/front-end-developers-vs-developers.html">previous post</a> 
  there is no <em>flow</em> for front-end developers in comparision to their back-end peers.
</p>
<p>
  Front-end developers &mdash; people coding in HTML and CSS &mdash; versus back-end developers &mdash; coding in Ruby, Python etc. &mdash;
  lack, amongst others but more importantly: 
  <ol>
    <li>Human friendly source code.</li>
    <li>Frameworks which distill industry best practices to speed up the creation of new projects.</li>
    <li>A bullet-proof and cheap testing mechanism on all browsers and platforms.</li>  
  </ol>
</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>
  Learning from others, especially from  
  <a href="{{ page.links[1].url }}" title="{{ page.links[1].title }}">Ruby</a> and the 
  <a href="{{ page.links[2].url }}" title="{{ page.links[2].title }}">Ruby on Rails</a> community, 
  there is a chance to solve all above problems.
</p>

<p>
  The goal must be to create a set of CSS/HTML and Javascript files embedding current best practices and tools,
  document well the underlying principles and techniques, and share them on Github for reuse and community building.
</p>

<p>
  This framework must cover all major aspects of the front-end development process:
  <ul>
    <li>Separating reusable tasks and parts into common files.</li>
    <li>Creating a responsible grid layout.</li>
    <li>Semantic identification and classification of elements.</li>
    <li>Typography.</li>
    <li>Documentation.</li>
    <li>Testing.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Separate CSS Files For A Layered And Reusable Structure</h2>
<p>
  One of the best practices Ruby and Rails developers learned was the mantra <em>Don't Repeat Yourself.</em>
</p>
<p>
  In this spirit every bit of code of yours is unique, not repeated elsewhere. The advantage is tremenduous:
  <ol>
    <li>You have to change code in a single place and will have global effects.</li>
    <li>Your code base is reduced to a minimum number of lines of code &mdash; no fat at all &mdash; for speed and easier maintenance.</li>
    <li>Some parts of your code become reusable accross all your projects.</li>
    <li>Your code will be built on independent, loosely coupled layers to enable fast adaptation for changes.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  In our case this principle applies first to CSS files.
</p>
<p>
  We know CSS is used for many different tasks: to reset the browser, to lay out the grid, 
  position elements, define their spacing, add colors and typo, etc.
</p>
<p>
  It would be straightforward to group these tasks into independent layers and associate a CSS file for it.
</p>  
<p>
  Each CSS file would be reusable accross current and future projects, and more, each CSS file would be built upon the other.
</p>
<p>
  As an example, and as a current best practice we use the following layers at Shopledge:
  <ol>
    <li><strong>base.css</strong>, to reset the browser and store common CSS classes like 
      <em>.alignright</em>, <em>ul.inline-list</em> etc.</li>
    <li><strong>layout.css</strong>, containing the grid, the typography and the spacing, formatting and 
      positioning of all elements.</li>
    <li><strong>theme.css</strong>, dealing exclusively with colouring spaces and elements of the design.</li>
    <li><strong>mobile.css</strong>, <strong>tablet.css</strong>, <strong>large.css</strong> 
    for different screen sizes.</li>
    <li><strong>ie.css</strong>, <strong>ie7.css</strong>, to stay compatible with Internet Explorer</li>  
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  These layers might look too few or too many for some readers but they satisfy one strong condition: 
  each of them is independent and only contains definitions meaningful on their own level of abstraction.
</p>  
<p>
  For example, <em>layout.css</em> might be split into <em>grid.css</em> and <em>typography.css</em> but in this case 
  horizontal positioning of elements given by the grid would be separated from the vertical rhythm given by the typography.
</p>
<p>
  Details are coming in the next chapters, important for now is to realise each level is dependent of the previous level, 
  independent itself, and this construct is highly changeable without breaking the entire context.
</p>



<h2>Identify The Site Structure</h2>
<p>
  Every site has it's own nature which defines it's own structure.
</p>

<p>
  For example a blog by it's nature is meant to display an article. 
  In plus it is equipped with a few list of articles meant to facilitate finding an article to be displayed. 
</p> 

<p>
  An online store has exactly the same structure: displaying a product, and some list of products to help navigation,
  and in plus it must have a shopping cart page.
</p>

<p>
  It turns out many websites <em>share</em> a common, basic structure: they display information, and helps user to find information.
</p>

<p>
  From the designer's point of view this means it will have to design two types of pages: 
  one displaying information, and the other displaying some lists, collections, archives.
</p>  

<p>
  Why this is so important? To determine the amount of work to be done &mdash; how many different pages must be designed &mdash;
  and to prepare to reuse as much classes and identifiers as possible.
</p>

<p>
  Let's compare a blog and an e-commerce site to find out the number of different page designs we'll have to create, and
  see how easily we can reduce the markup:
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>&nbsp;</th>
        <th>Blog</th>
        <th>Webshop</th>
        <th>Page type</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Frontpage</td>
        <td>Displays products, collections and information</td>
        <td>Displays posts, categories and information</td>
        <td>.frontpage</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Product / Article Page</td>
        <td>Displays a product and similar products</td>
        <td>Displays an article</td>
        <td>.page</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Collections / Archives Page</td>
        <td>Displays a list of products</td>
        <td>Displays a list of posts</td>
        <td>.collection</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Search Page</td>
        <td>Displays a list of products</td>
        <td>Displays a list of posts</td>
        <td>.collection</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Not Found Page</td>
        <td>Displays information</td>
        <td>Displays information</td>
        <td>.page</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>About us, Contact & similar pages</td>
        <td>Displays information</td>
        <td>Displays information</td>
        <td>.page</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Shopping Cart Page</td>
        <td>Displays a list of products</td>
        <td>n/a</td>
        <td>.collection</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
</p>

<p>
  It turns out we have to deal with three different page designs identifiable by: 
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/867309.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>
</p>
<p>
  Even more, if we later decide the <em>Not Found Page</em> must list some products or articles, by switching it's class
  to <em>.collection</em> the entire layout and page structure is immediately changed.
</p>



<h2>Identify Elements And Sketch-up Pages</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Design For Speed</li>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Don't use images for design.</li>

    <ol>
      <li>The shopping cart must be always visible.</li>
      <li>Products are always visually marked: either by price tag or with an "Add to Cart" button.</li>
      <li>The site must look like an online store in every aspect &mdash; 
      it must present all common elements webshops usually display.</li>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Product Name</li>

          <li>Sales and coupons.</li>
        </ol>
      
    </ol>
  
  <li>Usability</li>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Internal links, clicks, accordions are all working accurate.</li>

  <li>Pixel Perfect Design</li>
