excerpt: Every move you make must be measurable in dollars.

Every penny spent in your company must be *profitable*.
Even your support activities &mdash; non-sales oriented operations &mdash; 
must generate intangible profit like brand trust and customer satisfaction.

But now we will examine how to create and run campaigns to increase revenue.
If you spend blindly you can hit the headlines, and, in the same time
dig your own grave like [Groupon did](http://shortlogic.com/post/6142108636/groupon-ipo-pass-on-this-deal).

So focus on profit.

## Know Your Channels

Using the industry standard Google Analytics terms every website has the following
traffic sources &mdash; in e-commerce we call them sales channels.


* **Search Traffic ** &mdash; visitors brought to you by search engines like Google,
Bing, Yahoo etc.

* **Direct Traffic ** &mdash; visitors who already know you. They go straight to your
site without searching or clicking links pointing to you.

* **Referral Traffic ** &mdash; visitors comming to your site via links from other sites.
As a result of your link exchange or similar activities.

* **Campaigns ** &mdash; visits brought to you by online advertising platforms like
Google Adwords or Facebook Ads.

These are the major sources of revenue for your business.
You'll have to know how they work, how much you can spend on each channel,
how much profit they will generate, and when.

## Measure Your Channels

Google and its Analytics software is e-commerce's best friend.
They track and measure your sales, product performance, channel and campaign
performance, even how much revenue the navigation bar on your site generates.

Google Analytics for E-commerce talks business figures, *dollars*. 

You don't
have to use other tools to translate into profit common website metrics 
like Conversion Rate and make it relevant for you unique business details.

Google does that by using the **Per Visit Value** metric.

![{{ page.images[0].title }}]({{ site.images }}/{{ page.images[0].url }})

### Per Visit Value

The figure above tells us every visit we receive has a $2.22 value.
For 7,144 visits we have $15,828 revenue. For 10,000 visits we'll
probably have $22,220 revenue. 

And that's all. No more magic, calculations, excel sheets.

Since Google is smart the Per Visit Value can be used everywhere.
Like telling you which channels are performing better.
Or even more if Google Adwords brings more profit than Bing, Yahoo
or your e-mail newsletter and affiliates together.

With Per Visit Value you have **a universal metric** measuring:

1. **Your site performance** &mdash; product popularity, content quality, 
design performance, shopping cart performance and so on.
2. **Your business performance** &mdash; sales and marketing profitability, 
team effectiveness, the health of your business processes etc.

Using this metric what you'll have to care about is only to *spend less then
the Per Visit Value a channel offers.*

## On Planning Successful Campaigns

Shop owners must deal with the fact that campaigns are decreasing the site's
overall Conversion Rate and Per Visit Value. But they might / *must* 
increase sales and profit.
 
Without campaigns your site is reached by more involved audience who
found you by their own, looking for something which turns out to be you.

With campaigns visitors are somehow *forced* to visit your site thus
their value, motivation expressed in Conversion Rate and Per Visit Value is
lower.

The overall goal of campaigns is to expand the market and increase sales with
more work and investment from your side. Be prepared for that.

### Goals
 
Every campaign must have a clear goal &mdash; customer acquisition, 
returning customers &mdash; and must offer a reward for participants.

Caring about your existing customers is usually more profitable than
acquiring new customers unless you find niches really waiting for you.

Start with making your customers buy more &mdash; then bring new customers and make
them, again, to stay with you.

### Campaign Cost

Calculating campaign costs are first of all determined by the reach:
how many new visitors will you bring in?

Then these new visitors' value must be calculated taking into consideration
they will have less interest than existing visitors before the campaign.

With the two numbers above you'll approximate how much revenue you'll generate
with a campaign.

To make profit you must create costs &mdash; the cost of the running the campaign,
to measure the campaign and the rewards offered &mdash; lower than the
planned revenue.

### Consider Risk

Calculating revenue is guessing, calculating cost is mathemathics.

To stop loss you must first ask yourself: given these costs what is the
minimum number of new visitors / customers I must bring in to break even?

Always pay attention on campaign start to reach the break even point.
Then you can let freely the campaign flow, or stop it immediately to
avoid more damage.
