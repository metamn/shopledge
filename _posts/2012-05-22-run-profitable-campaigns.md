Every penny spent in your company must be *profitable*.
Even your support activities &mdash; non-sales oriented operations &mdash; 
must generate intangible profit like brand trust and customer satisfaction.

But now we will examine how to create and run campaigns increasing revenue.
If you spend blindly you can hit the headlines, and, in the same time
dig your own grave like [Groupon did](http://shortlogic.com/post/6142108636/groupon-ipo-pass-on-this-deal).

So focus on profit.

## Know Your Channels

Using the industry standard Google Analytics terms every website has the following
traffic sources &mdash; in e-commerce we call them sales channels.


* **Search Traffic ** &mdash; visitors brought to you by search engines like Google,
Bing, Yahoo etc.

* **Direct Traffic ** &mdash; visitors who already know you. They go straight to your
site without searching or clicking links pointing to you.

* **Referral Traffic ** &mdash; visitors comming to your site via links from other sites.
As a result of your link exchange or similar activities.

* **Campaigns ** &mdash; visits brought to you by online advertising platforms like
Google Adwords or Facebook Ads.

These are the major sources of revenue for your business.
You'll have to know how they work, how much you can spend on each channel,
how much profit they will generate, and when.
