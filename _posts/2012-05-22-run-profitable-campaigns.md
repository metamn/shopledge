excerpt: Every move you make is measurable in dollars.

Every penny spent in your company must be *profitable*.
Even your support activities &mdash; non-sales oriented operations &mdash; 
must generate intangible profit like brand trust and customer satisfaction.

But now we will examine how to create and run campaigns to increase revenue.
If you spend blindly you can hit the headlines, and, in the same time
dig your own grave like [Groupon did](http://shortlogic.com/post/6142108636/groupon-ipo-pass-on-this-deal).

So focus on profit.

## Know Your Channels

Using the industry standard Google Analytics terms every website has the following
traffic sources &mdash; in e-commerce we call them sales channels.


* **Search Traffic ** &mdash; visitors brought to you by search engines like Google,
Bing, Yahoo etc.

* **Direct Traffic ** &mdash; visitors who already know you. They go straight to your
site without searching or clicking links pointing to you.

* **Referral Traffic ** &mdash; visitors comming to your site via links from other sites.
As a result of your link exchange or similar activities.

* **Campaigns ** &mdash; visits brought to you by online advertising platforms like
Google Adwords or Facebook Ads.

These are the major sources of revenue for your business.
You'll have to know how they work, how much you can spend on each channel,
how much profit they will generate, and when.

## Measure Your Channels

Google and its Analytics software is e-commerce's best friend.
They track and measure your sales, product performance, channel and campaign
performance, even how much revenue the navigation bar on your site generates.

Google Analytics for E-commerce talks business figures, *dollars*. 

You don't
have to use other tools to translate into profit common website metrics 
like Conversion Rate and make it relevant for you unique business details.

Google does that by using the **Per Visit Value** metric.

![{{ page.images[0].title }}]({{ site.images }}/{{ page.images[0].url }})

### Per Visit Value

The figure above tells us every visit we receive has a $2.22 value.
For 7,144 visits we have $15,828 revenue. For 10,000 visits we'll
probably have $22,220 revenue. 

And that's all. No more magic, calculations, excel sheets.

Since Google is smart the Per Visit Value can be used everywhere.
Like telling you which channels are performing better.
Or even more if Google Adwords brings more profit than Bing, Yahoo
or your e-mail newsletter and affiliates together.

With Per Visit Value you have **a universal metric** measuring:

1. **Your site performance** &mdash; product popularity, content quality, 
design performance, shopping cart performance and so on.
2. **Your business performance** &mdash; sales and marketing profitability, 
team effectiveness, the health of your business processes etc.

Using this metric what you'll have to care about is only to *spend less then
the Per Visit Value a channel offers.*
