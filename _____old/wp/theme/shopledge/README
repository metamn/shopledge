How it works:
- all collections looks the same (index, search, tags, categories, archives, etc)
- on tag or category archive you can insert additional content by creating a page name with the title of the tag or category
  Ex.: '/category/portfolio' looks for a page named 'portfolio' and displays its content before listing all posts belonging to
the 'portfolio' category. 

Fonts:
- there are the following classes for custom fonts:
  .logo
  .site-name
  .site-description
  .menu
  .page-title
  .post-title
  

Settings:
- Media: 
  - thumbnail: 100x100
  - medium: 350x
  - large: 1024x
