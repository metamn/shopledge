  <h2>Our History</h2>  
  <p>
    We are a very successful company selling online since 2007.
  </p>
  <p>  
    We've started up via bootstrapping, by our own, with a technical and a business
    co-founder and a budget of a few thousands. 
    Our company operates in a small country of 20 million people and we
    sell premium gadgets and gizmos as gifts.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After becoming market leader in 2012 we've got an investment from local 
    angel investors building a portfolio of innovative e-commerce companies. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Together we are <em>to double</em> our revenue each year, by investing only 
    15% in marketing and sales.
    <br/>
    This is our story how to become a million dollar business &mdash; <strong>which we share
